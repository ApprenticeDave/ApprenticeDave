  - Automated systems and making everything easy
  - Artificual Inteligence - RAG/LLM's
  - Trust Systems - Evidence Tracking and Immutability
  - Game Dev
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently diving into multiple areas including Digital Trust, Knowledge Graphs, RAG, Unreal Game Dev, Robotics, and VS Code Extentions

Projects:

*[Visual Studio Code - Knowledge Map Extension](https://github.com/ApprenticeDave/VSCodeKnowledgeMap)*

This is a pet project of mine where I am trying to replicate some of the functionality in other note taking tools such as Obsidian so that I never need to leave Visual Studio Code. 

*[Unreal Engine Dev Tools](https://github.com/ApprenticeDave/UnrealDevUtils)*

Set of tools and tutorials for Unreal Engine. 

*Secret Project 1*

I am busy learning Unreal 5.5 by building a game and getting to understand the engineering pipeline. Hopefully one day I will actually get this out there.
